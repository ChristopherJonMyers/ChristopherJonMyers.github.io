        "Text": "I remember when you asked me what my greatest fear was.<br />Harry potter on my tv. <br />We weren’t watching. <br />We never did. <br />I still don’t know what happens in those movies. <br />Sitting cross-legged, <br />On the floor, <br />In front of my couch, <br />Facing each other, <br />You asked. <br />I paused for a second, then I said, <br /> “Watching myself hurt those I love most, and not being able to do anything about it.” <br />You sat speechless. <br /><br />After a time, <br />I echoed the question back. <br />You said, “Spiders.” <br /><br />I remember the first time you told me you loved me. <br />Arms entangled, <br />Legs intertwined, <br />Cold toes touching warm feet. <br />Smells of lavender and peaches. <br />Tastes of sweet espresso and honey. <br />With every kiss and touch<br />Our heart beats get closer to beating in unison. <br />You stopped me. <br /><br />You stared deep into my eyes<br />Mine brown, like a riverbed. <br />Yours blue, like crystal clear water. <br />Hands on my cheeks, <br />You hold my head still. <br />I see worry in your eyes, <br />As if you are about to jump of a precipice. <br />Your only reassurance is that I might catch you. <br />Eyes bounce as you read my face, <br />Checking one last time for red flags. <br />You took a deep breath in. <br />A leap of faith spilled from your mouth. <br /> “I Love You.” <br /> <br /> “I. Love. You.” <br />Your heart falling, <br />Only hoping to be caught, <br />As you wait for my response. <br />I move your hands off my face<br />And put your arms around my neck. <br /> “I love you too.”"

        "Text": "I met you at English Dinner,<br />You hosted every Sunday. <br />At first attendance I felt like a foreigner. <br />Conversations consisted of Dickinson, Hamilton, and the enneagram. <br />All I knew was computation, calculations, and how to program. <br />I was a programmer and you were a poet. <br />Yet, you welcomed me anyway. <br /><br />At a young age I learned <br />How to compartmentalize. <br />Positively reinforced by the result of a calm house. <br />I put my pains into their own box. <br />With locks, I kept them safe from those I loved. <br />Parents called me stoic, <br />Teachers said I was wise beyond my years. <br />Honestly, I just learned how to bight my tongue. <br />Was bighting so long, <br />When I spoke, I tasted blood. <br /><br />Between bowls of vegan chili and slices of fine cheese<br />You taught me. <br />It wasn’t okay to suppress myself. <br />It was nonbeneficial for my mental health. <br />I needed to let my tongue go<br />And let the blood clot. <br />But I didn’t know how to stop biting. <br /><br />You taught me the power of poetry. <br />A therapy I will never take for granted. <br />With each line that rhymed<br />I felt my atrophied vocal cords vibrate. <br />Like a guitar naturally resonates. <br /><br />Truthfully, I spent most English dinners in derealization. <br />Another mechanism I learned to cope. <br />I learned how to code to hide my mental state. <br />But you could see through my façade. <br />Like Roddy Piper, <br />You saw me as I was. <br />Just a lost kid trying his best to find a home. <br />You could see me because you weren’t afraid to admit that you were one too. <br />Like we all are. <br />Like everyone is."

        "Text": "A pen that has ran out of ink<br />Can only leave an indent on the paper, <br />The intent of creating without the creation. <br />Painting with pigment-less paint. <br />No matter how precise and thought out the strokes are, <br />The skill, the thought, the passion doesn’t show. <br />Singing when no one is around. <br />No confirmation of beauty, or anyone to listen. <br /><br />I am afraid that if I don’t write something meaningful<br />My voice will only be heard, but not listed to. <br /><br />A flashlight with a broken bulb. <br />It has what it needs but can’t shine. <br />Like a ship without a sale<br />My words might get lost in a stream of incoherent thought and emotions. <br />Like when you are trying desperately to take notes and the professor is talking too fast. <br />A feeble attempt to record every word of importance <br />Your handwriting deteriorates <br />To an illegible rat’s nest of cursive and print. <br /><br />Being afraid of failure is just another way to feel alive. <br /><br />Like riding a rollercoaster to feel scared. <br />Like standing over a cliff just to feel carnal urge to jump, <br />And say “no” to it. <br />So you can say you’re in control. <br />Because truth is, we are never in control."

        "Text": "A jobless vagabond, <br />Counting my days to destitution. <br />Maybe being a starving artist will be my restitution. <br />I’ll pinch pennies to buy white rice and black beans. <br />Maybe treat myself to some top ramen with a dash of Frank’s Red Hot. <br />Like a jazz musician, <br /> I’ll improvise lines at an open mic to pick up a few dollars. <br />Maybe I’ll reharmonize <br />A melancholy cover of <i>Sweater Weather</i> <br />And impress some white collars. <br />People seem to like that song."
