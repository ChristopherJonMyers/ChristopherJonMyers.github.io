Trackless train of thought.,I like to drink specialty coffee and Craft beer<br/>And contemplate the things in life that I fear. <br/>But sometimes my emotions get the best of me<br/>When I can’t handle the things that I see. <br/><br/>I used to big dreams<br/>About playing in the Major Leagues. <br/>Now I write resumes and fill out CV’s <br/>To get a 401k and work in IT. <br/><br/>Sometimes I think<br/>About what life would be like<br/>If In my late teens<br/>I wasn’t so uptight. <br/><br/>I hate how it takes people to break me. <br/>I guess the best lessons require a bad experience<br/>Just so that I can become better me. <br/>Why does that have to make so much goddamn since?
